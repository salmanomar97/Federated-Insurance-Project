# Federated-Insurance-Project
This repository is the group project that I worked on for my Systems Analysis and Design class. We had a chance to work with Federated Insurance who asked us to recreate their Customer Relationship Management System (CRM). 
We spent the semester building up the CRM from scratch as we moved through phases and used some project managemnt methodologies. 
We made ERDs and DFDs to define users roles and functions. We then mocked up a user interface where the marketer can log in to daily.
